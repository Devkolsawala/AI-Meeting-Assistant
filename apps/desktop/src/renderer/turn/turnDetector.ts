/**
 * Them-channel end-of-turn detection (MeetCopilot Parts B + D).
 *
 * Decides WHEN the other speaker ("them") has actually finished a question/request
 * so the overlay can fire one inference at the right moment — instead of firing on
 * interim transcripts or short pauses (which answers half a question).
 *
 * This module is deliberately decoupled from the "you" channel and from the network:
 *   - The caller feeds it ONLY them-channel signals (channel gating happens upstream
 *     in the STT adapter / renderer hook).
 *   - The completeness decision is injected as `gate` (see completenessGate.ts).
 *   - The fire action is injected as `onFire`; this module never calls /infer itself.
 *
 * State machine (them channel only):
 *   IDLE -> ACCUMULATING -> CANDIDATE_END -> SETTLING -> FIRE -> IDLE
 *
 * On a candidate end-of-turn the settle timer and the gate run CONCURRENTLY (Part D #1):
 * gate latency is hidden under the settle window we already wait, so the gate budget
 * can be generous without adding perceived latency.
 *
 * Bias: patience. Firing ~800ms late is acceptable; firing early is the bug.
